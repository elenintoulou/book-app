# Book App (Hibernate Practice Project)
---------------------------------------

This is a **simple Java console application** built to practice:

- âœ… Hibernate ORM
- âœ… Lombok annotations
- âœ… JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)
- âœ… JPA mappings (OneToMany, ManyToOne)

##  What it does
----------------

This app manages **books** and **authors**, stored in a **MySQL database** using Hibernate.


##  Notes
----------

This project is **purely educational** and was created to help me learn and experiment with JPA & Hibernate features. It is not meant for production use.

ðŸ”§ More features and improvements may be added as I learn more!
